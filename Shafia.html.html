    <h1><Center>Freelancing And Its Scop In Pakistan</center></h1>
    <section>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>A freelancer is someone who offers their services for a fee and usually with no expectation of a permanent single client, although the working relationship can be ongoing. It's a form of <strong>self-employment</strong>, similar to operating a home business versus telecommuting. With that said, a freelancer can work as a contractor, as opposed to a home business.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Why Freelancing?</h2>
    <section>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>There are several reasons to start freelancing:
        <!--unorderd list-->
      <ul>
        <li>Done on the side around your job, it's a way to generate extra income to pay off debt or save for a rainy day.</li>
        <li>It's affordable to start if you already have the skills and equipment to do the job.</li>
        <li>You can start quickly. As soon as you find a client, you can start getting paid to freelance.</li>
        <li>It allows for greater independence over a job.</li>
        <li>It's often flexible, allowing you to <i><strong style="color:blue">work part-time or during off-business</strong></i> hours.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>There can be a few downsides, including:
      <ul>
        It can take time to build a full-time income.
        Work, and therefore, income, can be irregular.
        Managing multiple clients and projects requires excellent organization.
        Pay for new freelancers is often low.
      </ul></p>

    <h3 class="heading">What Do You Need to Get Started?</h3>
    <section>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>To freelance, you need to have a skill you can offer to potential clients. Most people draw on their employment experience, offering services using the talents they already have. Along with a service, some things to consider putting together include:
        <!--unorderd list-->
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong><u style="color:blue">business plan</u></strong>. While you may not be setting up an official home business, contact your city or county to determine if you need a business license to freelance. You will still need a plan that outlines what service you'll provide, the market you'll cater too, and marketing strategies.</li>
        <li>A <strong><u style="color:blue">website</u></strong> that tells about you and your services, and includes a portfolio of your work, and testimonials.</li>
        <li>A <strong><u style="color:blue">LinkedIn profile</u></strong>. While all social media can be a great resource to network for freelance work, LinkedIn is an online resume located in a place where professionals connect. It's also a great resource for ​finding freelance jobs.</li>
        <li>A <strong><u style="color:blue">dedicated business phone or cell phone number</u></strong> on which prospects can reach you</li>
        <li>A <strong><u style="color:blue">business card</u></strong>.</li>
        <li>A menu of services and your <strong><u style="color:blue">freelance rates</u></strong>.</li>
      </ul></p>

    <h4 class="heading">How Big Is The Freelancing Market In Pakistan?</h4>
    <section>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>In a 2018 report, citing data from the World Bank and freelancing websites, it was claimed that there were more than 60,000 freelancers in Pakistan. However, this is a careful estimate.</p>
      <p>Then in a 2019 report, Pakistan’s freelancing market was reviewed. According to the results of The Global Gig Economy Index, freelancing revenue in Pakistan was seen to increase by 42% over 2018.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the significant growth in the industry, Pakistan came in fourth among the 10 largest countries in the world. The United States was at the top of the list, while India was seventh and Bangladesh was eighth.</p>

    <h5 class="heading">Is Freelancing a Good Career in Pakistan?</h5>
    <section>
      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p>With the job market being very saturated in Pakistan, youngsters are looking to join big firms and companies like KPMG, Deloitte, Mobilink and Nestle etc. But there are a lot of people who like to work independently and do not want a boring desk job. A 9 to 5 office job in Pakistan demands you to be a corporate slave following office decorum, meeting deadlines, conference calls and meetings. Waking up early and sleeping late, stressing a person completely are the main features of an office job. Then there’s the BOSS, always bossing around and ordering the employees. People in Pakistan do not like being bossed around that much, but joining the corporate world demands to follow orders. And who likes orders? Yup, that’s right. </p>
      <p>Freelancing allows you to be your own boss. People who are disciplined and are good at handling themselves have chosen this field. Elance, one of the leading freelancing sites, revealed that Pakistan ranks third in the total registered members. The first two are US and India. Another website, freelance.com also has a high number of registered members from Pakistan. The top categories of Pakistan in freelancing are in IT and Design. In monetary terms, Pakistan is earning about $0.5 billion entirely from freelancing and is ranked the 4th most popular country for freelancing. This shows Pakistani freelancers have so much to earn from freelancing.</p>

    <h6 class="heading">Most young Pakistanis opting to go freelance: Report2020</h6>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Most Pakis­tanis under the age of 35 (90per cent) are opting to go into freelance work — more than the global average of 70pc, according to a report released by the digital payment company Payoneer.</strong></p>
      <p>The report titled ‘Freelancer Income Report 2020’ is based on a survey of over 7,000 freelancers from 150 countries, including emerging markets such as Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Payoneer says more people (75pc) are going freelance full-time due to income satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Freelancing’s popularity is attributed to the potential for greater job opportunity, independence, higher income and a promising move in the direction of wage equality.</p>
        <p>Men and women in Pakistan selected web and graphic design as the most popular freelancing field.</p>
        <p>In terms of advertising on social media, Pakistani freelancers are most reliant on Facebook and LinkedIn. However, according to Payoneer, in 2020 advertisements on Facebook declined from previous years with LinkedIn increasing by 1pc from 2018.</p>
        <p>The data showed that even with the growth of co-working spaces in the country, 81pc of Pakistani freelancers prefer to work from home.</p>
        <q cite="https://www.dawn.com/news/1533714", style="background-color:yellow" style="color:red"><i><strong style="color:red">Payoneer report says freelance economy offers unparalleled opportunity for growth</strong></i></q>
        <p>“Pakistan has remained in the top 5 freelancing markets in the world consistently. Now is the time our small and midsize businesses (SMBs) grow beyond borders and drive Pakistan’s digital economy,” said Payoneer’s country manager Mohsin Muzzafer</p>
        <p>“More people now consider freelancing as a full-time career as opposed to a part-time gig, which is a big shift to positivity. This also means an increased landscape of opportunity for our youth and the overall impact on digital Pakistan,” he added.</p><br>
